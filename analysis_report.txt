PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:

1. ALGORITHM EFFICIENCY:
   - A* consistently finds optimal paths with fewer node expansions than BFS/UCS
   - UCS guarantees optimal solutions but expands more nodes than A*
   - BFS finds shortest paths in terms of steps but not necessarily optimal cost
   - Simulated Annealing provides good solutions but with some randomness

2. SCALABILITY:
   - A* shows best scalability across map sizes
   - BFS performance degrades significantly on larger maps
   - UCS maintains optimality but with increased computation time
   - Simulated Annealing execution time is more predictable

3. OPTIMALITY:
   - UCS and A* provide optimal solutions
   - BFS provides shortest path in steps but may not be cost-optimal
   - Simulated Annealing provides near-optimal solutions

4. DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS:
   - A* adapts well to dynamic obstacle replanning
   - Local search methods like Simulated Annealing handle dynamic changes effectively
   - BFS/UCS require complete replanning for dynamic obstacles

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use A* for general pathfinding with optimal results and good performance
- Use UCS when optimality is critical and computational resources are available
- Use Simulated Annealing for dynamic environments with frequent changes
- Use BFS for simple scenarios where step count matters more than cost
